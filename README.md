This is a packing list project built with React with following functionality and key concepts:
- We can;
  - add friends to the friends list using dinamically opening "Add Friend" form by their name and an placeholder avatar will be placed with Pravatar.
  - see that each friend object contains balance to show if you owe money to your friend or your friend owes you.
  - select a friend and enter values to ourselves and our friend and then select who is paying the bill.
  - keep the record according to this entry in our friends object and display balance with different colors.
- In this project; props, prop drilling, state, lifting the state up, derived state, handling forms and submittion, controlled elements and conditional rendering were practiced.
